# Tiny Stretch site

I'm trying to get more flexible, but I find going through other peoples stretch routines boring. My best times stretching have been like, a saturday morning watching a soccer game.

So: a little minisite that just refreshes a random stretch recommendation: one for shoulders/back, one for legs/hips.
